# Description
Tic Tac Toe Game in 8086 Assembly. I used TASM (Turbo Assembler) that can run on x86 Windows OS or inside the DOSBox on x86-64 Windows OS. In this game the match is between a user and a machine, and also you can not beat the machine because of its intelligence, just maybe you could be equal :)


# Usage
First clone the repository by:
```
git clone https://github.com/TechieForFun/tictactoe8086asm.git
```
or by downloading it. Then on x86 Windows OS or inside the DOSBox on x86-64 Windows at the project folder run:
```
ASM.BAT TICTACTOE.ASM
```
Then run the .exe output file.


# Contribution
I did not run it on Linux or other OSes, so please let me know if you did run it.
